volume contolled breathing loop

variables
pressure = air pressure, -2 to 40 cmH2O
oroficeDrop = delta pressure across orofice 
flowPerPa = an imperically determined flow rate per Pascal of oroficeDrop maybe a constant and may be a different value for different pressure ranges
stepTime = time of last step pulse
BPM = breaths per minute
breathStart = time in millis of begining of inspiration
IoverE = ratio of inhale time to exhale time
Itime = (1/BPM)*(1-IoverE) (this formula is not right)
tidal = total tidal volume desired
currentTidal = tidal volume since start of inspiration
Pmax = maximum pressure allowable
PEEP = measured back pressure provided by PEEP valve 
accel = current desired signed accelleration
flowDesired = ideal flow rate for duration of inspiration
flowError = what is the difference between current and desired flow rate (cc/sec).
errorDir = are we too fast or too slow
Perror = delta between desired pressure and actual pressure

Motor variables
dir = current motor direction
currentStepInterval = time interval between last step and step before that
currentVelocity = 1/ currentStepInterval * dir
stepTime = time of last step pulse


Constants
pulseLength = minimum time in micros that the step pin has to be held high to trigger the motor driver to step once.
directionLag = minimum time from changing the value of the direction variable until delivering the next pulse
pulseMin = minimum time in seconds between step pulses at max velocity (1/max velocity in pulses per second) 
accel = the maximum safe accelleration possible without losing steps


flow controlled breathing loop

setup:
determine Itime
determine flowDesired
set breathStart = millis
open valve to pre-determine

loop:
loop until (tidal volume reached, max inspiration pressure reached, time of 120% Itime is reached)
	read current pressure
	read current oroficeDrop
	calculate current flow rate
	calculate current flowError
	use flowError to calculate desired velocity and direction (greater error means greater desired velocity)
	currentVelocity = currentVelocity+accel*currentStepInterval*errorDir
	check new currentVelocity to see if it has changed sign
		update dir if velocity has changed
	calculate time of next step pulse
	calculate volume for current time interval
	update currentTidal
	check to see if it is time for another step
